# Superstore Sales Analysis (MySQL)

This project provides a data-driven analysis of the Superstore dataset using MySQL queries. It focuses on data cleaning, summarization, trend analysis, and performance insights by region, product, category, and time period.


## Objective

To answer key business questions like:
- What is the total sales, profit, and quantity sold?
- Which region or category is the most profitable?
- Which products are underperforming?
- What are the monthly sales trends?
- How do discounts affect profit margins?


## Dataset

- Table Name: superstore_orders
- Records: ~9994
- Columns: Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount, Order Date, Region, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, etc.
- Source: Sample - Superstore (Kaggle)

## Tools Used

- MySQL (tested on MySQL 8.0+)
- SQL Workbench 
- SQL Functions: `SUM()`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `DATE_FORMAT()`, `CASE`, `ROUND()`

---

## Key Insights

- West region  has the highest sales overall
- Technology is the top category by both profit and sales
- Found invalid rows with `Quantity <= 0` and `Sales <= 0` (data cleaning step)
- Bottom 300 products are losing money
- Peak sales observed in November–December
- High discounts lead to lower profit margins in some categories

##  Data Cleaning Queries

sql
--Check for null values in key fields
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN Sales IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Null_Sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Profit IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Null_Profit
FROM superstore_orders;

-- Remove rows with invalid sales or quantity
SELECT * FROM superstore_orders WHERE Quantity <= 0 OR Sales <= 0;
